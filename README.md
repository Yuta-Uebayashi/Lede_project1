# Rising Popularity of Private Junior High Schools in Japan
Overview
This project investigates the growing trend of private junior high school attendance in Japan. Amidst a declining birthrate and increasing educational competition, more parents are choosing private education for their children. What are the driving factors behind this shift?

What I Tried to Accomplish
My goal was to visualize how the popularity of private junior high schools is changing over time and to explore possible reasons for this shift — such as regional disparities, rising education costs, and the structure of entrance exams. I aimed to combine storytelling with interactive data visualization to make the topic accessible to a wide audience.

Summary of Findings
In many urban areas, the percentage of students attending private junior high schools is increasing, especially in Tokyo and Osaka.

Entrance exam timing, cram school (juku) culture, and perceived educational quality all appear to influence parental decisions.

The cost burden is high, but families are still willing to invest in private education.

Demographic shifts are also a key factor: in areas where the number of children is declining, schools are adapting with new strategies to remain competitive.

Data Collection Process
The main data source was the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (MEXT), which provides publicly available statistics on school attendance by type (public/private) and prefecture.

I manually downloaded and cleaned multiple Excel files across years and combined them into a single dataset suitable for analysis.

Data Analysis Process
The data was processed and cleaned using Python (pandas, matplotlib).

Interactive maps were created using Datawrapper to highlight regional differences in private school attendance.

Trends over time were visualized and annotated to help readers understand shifts in educational behavior.

Skills and Growth
This project helped me improve in several areas:

I learned how to use Datawrapper and GeoJSON to create interactive choropleth maps.

I deepened my understanding of Japan’s education system through policy reports and academic papers.

I practiced storytelling techniques to structure my article as a clear, engaging narrative.

What I Wanted to Do (But Couldn’t Yet)
Due to time and technical limitations, I wasn’t able to:

Build a fully interactive dashboard with filters and custom layers.

Integrate scraped data from cram schools or entrance exam calendars.

Interview parents or school administrators for qualitative insight.

These are areas I may pursue in a future update of this project.
