## Why More Parents Are Choosing Private Junior High Schools in Japan(https://yuta-uebayashi.github.io/Lede_project1/)

### Overview

This project explores why an increasing number of parents in Japan, especially in urban areas, are choosing private junior high schools for their children — despite rising costs and a declining birthrate.

## Project Goal

The aim of this project was to investigate the link between the growing popularity of private education and Japan's low fertility rate. The story also seeks to understand whether the burden of educational expenses is discouraging families from having more children.

## Key Findings

- Applications to private junior high schools remain high even as the number of children declines.
- The rate of entrance exam takers is significantly higher in wealthier districts.
- Private schools dominate the list of high schools that send the most students to the University of Tokyo.
- Educational inequality caused by income disparity may be contributing to Japan’s declining birthrate.

## Data Collection

Data was collected from a variety of public and institutional sources:

- Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (MEXT)
- Tokyo Metropolitan Government and local municipalities
- The Nippon Foundation Survey on Fertility Intentions

- [Flourish Charts](https://public.flourish.studio/)
- [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/Yuta-Uebayashi/Lede_project1)

## Data Analysis Process

- Cleaned and transformed statistical data using spreadsheets and Python.
- Analyzed income and enrollment correlations by Tokyo municipality.
- Visualized spatial patterns using Datawrapper and Flourish.
- Designed a scrollytelling narrative with HTML/CSS, integrating interactive charts and maps.

## Skills and Growth

Through this project, I gained new skills in:

- HTML and responsive web design
- Embedding and customizing interactive charts
- Mapping with Datawrapper and Flourish
- Storytelling with data for social impact
- Exploring structural inequality using visual journalism

## Limitations and Future Work

I wanted to analyze parent interviews and school-level policy documents, but time and language constraints limited my ability to do so. In the future, I hope to:

- Conduct qualitative interviews with families and educators
- Add a time-series analysis of enrollment trends over the past 20 years
- Improve the design and accessibility of the mobile experience
