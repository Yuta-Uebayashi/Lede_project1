**This is the first project I‚Äôve worked on at [Lede](https://yuta-uebayashi.github.io/Lede_project1/).**

## üè∑Ô∏è Title  
**Why More Parents Are Choosing Private Junior High Schools in Japan**

---

## üéØ Project Goal  
This project visualizes how private junior high schools in Japan are gaining popularity, even as the country faces a sharp decline in its birthrate. Through data analysis, it explores the factors behind this trend and examines the relationship between the rise in private school enrollment and the ongoing population decline.

## üîç Findings

- The percentage of students taking private junior high school entrance exams is increasing, despite the overall decline in the child population.  
- Exam rates are higher in central Tokyo, where average household income is also higher.  
- The majority of University of Tokyo admits come from private schools in central Tokyo.  
- Educational expenses vary significantly depending on household income.  
- Many households cite high education costs as a major reason for not having children.
